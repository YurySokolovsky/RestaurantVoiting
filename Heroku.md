## Heroku


If you did not go to this page with GitHub, then you were redirected to Heroku.
This could happen for several reasons:
- the server is temporarily unavailable;
- you have not used the app for more than 30 minutes;
- there was a temporary server failure.

You should wait some time and try again: http://restvoiting.herokuapp.com
